## Project Description

This project is made for Software Engineering (In≈ºynieria Oprogramowania) classes at the University of Warsaw, academic year 2022/23.

It is a website that enables playing Hand&Brain chess with other players.

Hand&Brain chess is a variant of chess played by two teams, each consisting of two players. In each team, one player takes on the role of 
the `brain`, and the other player is the `hand`. The `brain` player decides which 
chess piece should be moved, and the `hand` player executes the actual move on the chessboard.

### Features

- Create a room or join an existing one to play Hand&Brain chess with other players.
- Choose your team (Team 1 or Team 2) and your role (brain or hand) within the team.
- The `brain` player selects the chess piece to move, and the `hand` player makes the move on the chessboard.
- Real-time updates to keep track of the current game state and player turns.
- Visual representation of the chessboard using [the javascript chess library](https://chessboardjs.com/docs).

Please note that this is still an early version of the project, and it may be further developed in the future.
